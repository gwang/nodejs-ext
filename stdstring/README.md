1. Basic code is based on what was posted at this [tutorial on how to extend Node.js](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/writing-nodejs-addons--cms-21771).
2. However, the code there was based on the APIs of an earlier version of v8 (Node 0.10).  I then improved the code to make it work with Node v0.12.
